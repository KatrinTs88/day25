			<h1>Willom Crest</h1>
			<p class="first">Willow Crest is best known for its estate-grown aromatic white wines from Washington State’s Yakima Valley. The Minick Family first planted wine grapes on their Roza farm, North of Prosser in 1982. In 1995, David J. Minick, a third generation farmer, took grape-growing to the next level by making handcrafted wine from select blocks of the family vineyard and soon after, bottled the first vintage of Willow Crest. Focusing on aromatic white wines, Willow Crest Winery uses estate grown fruit that David plants, cultivates, and harvests.</p>
			<p>After growing grapes for other winemakers in the Yakima Valley for more than a decade, third generation Washington farmer David Minick realized a long-time dream of producing his own wine with the opening of Willow Crest Winery in 1995. Minick oversees the family vineyard estate, with nearly 300 acres of grapes, and retains a small amount of his annual harvest to craft nearly 3,000 cases of premium wine. He credits Tefft Cellars founder Joel Tefft for mentoring him in quality, small-lot winemaking.</p>
			<p>Jon brings 30 years of experience working in Washington State’s wine industry, working in wineries with annual productions ranging from 5,000 cases to over 1 million cases. Over the past 15 years, he’s worked directly in wine making. Through his tenure, Jon has balanced the art of winemaking with technology, strategic planning and organization. Jon has been crafting wine for Willow Crest since 2014. Prior to that Jon served as assistant winemaker at Canoe Ridge Vineyard from 2012-2014, working directly with winemaker Bill Murray. Jon previously served as the winemaker for Tefft Cellars in Outlook, Wash.</p>
			<p class="last"> Jon resides in the heart of Washington wine country in Prosser.</p>
